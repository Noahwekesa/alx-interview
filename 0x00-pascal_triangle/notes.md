# Pascal's Triangle

- Pascals Triangle or Pascal's triangle is an arrangement of binomial coefficients in triangle form.
- It is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal.

## What is Pascal's Triangle?

- A Pascal's Triangle is arrangement of numbers in a triangular array such that the numbers at the end of each row are 1 and the remaining numbers are the sum of the nearest two numbers in the above row.

# What are Python Algotithms?

- **Python algorithms** provide a detailed set of instructions by which you can process data for a specific purpose.
- The most well-known are sorting and graph.
- **Algorithms** are not language-specific and have no standard rules dictating how they should be written.

## 4 WELL-KNOWN PYTHON ALGORITHMS

1. Tree Traversal

   - Are designed to visit all nodes of a tree graph, starting from the root and traversing each node according to the instructions laid out.

2. Sorting

   - Provide various ways of arranging data in a particular format, with common algorithms including bubble sort, quicksort, and merge sort.

3. Searching

   - check and retrieve elements from different data structures, with various including linear search and binary search

4. Graph algorithms
   - Are designed to traverse graphs, with common algorithms including depth-first search and breadth-first search.

### HOW TO WRITE A PYTHON ALGORITHM: 6 CHARACTERISTICS

1. Unambiguous and has clear steps
2. Zero or more well-defined inputs
3. One or more defined outputs

4. must terminate after a finite number of steps
5. Must be feasible to implement
6. written in a language that the computer can understand
